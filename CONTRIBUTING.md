# Contributing to a project of the RDF-Ext organization

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make RDF-Ext even better than it is today!
Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

## Discussions

The [discussions project](https://github.com/rdf-ext/discussions/issues) is the right place to talk about general RDF-Ext topics.
If you are not sure to which project your topic belongs, just open an issue in that project.

## Styleguide

All projects managed in the RDF-Ext organization use the [standard code style](http://standardjs.com/).
Standard is also configured in the `test` script in every `package.json` file.
So you can use `npm test` to check the style.

## Pull Requests

All developers, also members of the organization, must use forks and pull requests to submit contributions.

## Branches

Gitflow is used to manage branches and versions.
The workflow is described [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [here](https://de.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

## Tests

All contributions should be covered by a mocha test.
